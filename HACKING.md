# Hacking

Start the development webserver so you can view your local edits on
[https://localhost:1313]

```
make develop
```

Generate the website locally to ./public

```
make build
```

Publish the website by pushing the locally generated static files to the
`gh-pages` branch of the repo `https://github.com/cisco-sso/kdf`.

```
make publish
```
